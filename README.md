# **Sampling**
Analyzing different sampling techniques
This project compares the performance of 5 different machine learning models on 5 different sampling techniques for imbalanced datasets.

Random-over sampling is used to make dataset balanced dataset

## The sampling techniques used in this project are:
### Probability Sampling:
1. Simple-Random Sampling
2. Systematic Sampling
3. Cluster Sampling
4. Stratified Sampling

### Non-Probability Sampling:
Convenience Sampling

## The machine learning models used in this project are:
1. Support Vector Machine
2. Logistic Regression
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Random Forest
5. Naive Bayes Classifier

## The project is implemented in Python using the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- seaborn
- mathplotlib

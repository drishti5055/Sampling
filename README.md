# Sampling
Analyzing different sampling techniques
This project compares the performance of 5 different machine learning models on 5 different sampling techniques for imbalanced datasets.

## The sampling techniques used in this project are:
### Probability Sampling:
Simple-Random Sampling
Systematic Sampling
Cluster Sampling
Stratified Sampling

### Non-Probability Sampling:
Convenience Sampling

## The machine learning models used in this project are:
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors
Random Forest
Naive Bayes Classifier

## The project is implemented in Python using the following libraries:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
